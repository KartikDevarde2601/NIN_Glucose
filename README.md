# Health Monitoring App

This is a [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) application for collecting and managing vital health data, including **glucose levels**, **body temperature**, **GSR (Galvanic Skin Response)**, and **bioimpedance**. Designed for reliable use in both connected and offline settings, it employs an **offline-first architecture** to ensure seamless data collection in areas with limited connectivity. Communication with health-monitoring devices is handled via **MQTT**, enabling efficient and real-time data exchange.

## Key Features

- **Offline-First Architecture**: Collects and stores data locally, syncing to the server when a connection is available.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Utilizes MQTT for efficient and lightweight communication with health-monitoring devices.
- **Data Visualization**: Offers visual insights into collected health metrics within the app.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Supports both Android and iOS platforms.
